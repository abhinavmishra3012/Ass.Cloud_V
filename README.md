HTML:
The card contains a profile picture (img), name (h2), designation (p), bio (p), and social media icons (a tags). These elements are grouped within a container (div).

CSS:
Styling includes centering the card, applying a shadow, and ensuring responsiveness using media queries. Hover effects scale the card for interactivity.



2. String Manipulation - Anagram Check (Java)
Objective:
Write a Java program that checks if two input strings are anagrams, meaning they contain the same characters but in a different order.

Explanation:

The program compares the sorted versions of both strings. If both strings are identical after sorting, they are anagrams; otherwise, they are not.
You can achieve this by converting both strings to character arrays, sorting them, and comparing them.
3. Object-Oriented Programming - Employee Management System (Java)
Objective:
Design a simple Employee class with attributes like ID, name, and salary. Create methods to display employee details and store multiple Employee objects.

Explanation:

The Employee class contains attributes (id, name, salary) and a method to display details.
In the main method, create at least 3 Employee objects, store them in a list, and print their details using the display method.




4. Simple To-Do List (JavaScript + DOM)
Objective:
Create a to-do list that allows users to add tasks, display them, and remove individual tasks.

Explanation:

Use JavaScript to dynamically add tasks to a list displayed on the webpage.
Each task is represented as an HTML element, with a remove button next to it.
Add event listeners to allow adding new tasks and removing them upon clicking the respective button.





5. DOM Manipulation - Image Slider (JavaScript)
Objective:
Create an image slider that displays one image at a time with navigation buttons.

Explanation:

Store the image URLs in an array. The slider displays one image at a time.
Use JavaScript to implement Next and Previous buttons, which change the currently displayed image by updating the index in the array.
The buttons trigger functions that navigate through the array of images.
